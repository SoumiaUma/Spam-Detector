# CSCI 2020U - Assignment 1

Project Information

The purpose of this project is to create a spam detector that will train itself using some spam and not spam (ham) emails. The spam detector uses a dataset of E-Mails (spam or otherwise) to train the program to recognize whether or not new E-Mails are spam. The program will use a unigram approach, where each word is counted and associated with whether or not the message is spam. Our program calculates probabilities based on each wordâ€™s frequency. The accuracy and the precision of the spam detector are the statistics used in this project to determine the effectiveness of the spam detector. The Naive Bayes spam filtering and Bag-of-words model was used for training the spam detector.
